Manually:
1. SmartStore.Web and SmartStore.Admin are two web applications. They both need to be published to the same directory. 
   “SmartStore.Web” to “Published\Web\”. “SmartStore.Admin” to “Published\Web\Administration\”. Make sure the .dlls 
   from SmartStore.Admin (Published\Web\Administration\bin\) are moved and exist in (Published\Web\bin\).
2. Ensure that plugins (\Presentation\SmartStore.Web\Plugins) are copied into \Published\Web\Plugins\ directory
3. Select all the files in Published\Web\ directory and upload them to your web server.


Automatic:
1. SmartStore.NET package with source code contains two .bat files for deploying, that will deploy everything correctly for you 
   to a "\Deployable\" folder.”. The first file is src\Prepare.bat. This file will build the project in release mode and move the 
   plugins to the correct directory. The second file is src\Deploy.bat. This file will do what Prepare.bat does, 
   but will also move all the websites and files to src\Deployable\Nop_2.X.
   Note: Before running the files make sure you build the project in Visual Studio.
2. Select all the files in src\Deployable\Nop_2.X directory and upload them to your web server.
   Note: If you're getting an error, try to compile the solution in Visual Studio before running the .bat files
