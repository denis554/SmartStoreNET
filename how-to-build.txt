Manually:
1. SmartStore.Web and SmartStore.Admin are two web applications. They both need to be published to the same directory. 
   “SmartStore.Web” to “Published\Web\”. “SmartStore.Admin” to “Published\Web\Administration\”. Make sure the .dlls 
   from SmartStore.Admin (Published\Web\Administration\bin\) are moved and exist in (Published\Web\bin\).
2. Ensure that plugins (\Presentation\SmartStore.Web\Plugins) are copied into \Published\Web\Plugins\ directory
3. Select all the files in Published\Web\ directory and upload them to your web server.


Automatic:
1. SmartStore.NET package with source code contains the "ClickToBuild.cmd" batch file, which will deploy everything correctly for you 
   to a "Stage" folder. The build process will build the project in release mode and move all 
   compiled and deployable files to the correct directory.
   Note: Before running the file make sure you built the project in Visual Studio.
2. Select all the files in "build\Web" directory and upload them to your web server.
   Note: If you're getting an error, try to compile the solution in Visual Studio before running the .bat file
