Entity Framework Migrations:
============================

As of March 11 2014, SmartStore.NET fully supports Entity Framework code-based migrations (changeset 7920a6d2c0e0). 
From this date on, database migration is NOT performed manually with plain SQL files anymore, but with auto-generated 
code files which get compiled into the app and executed automatically on app startup.

If you are migrating from a version PRIOR to March 11 2014 (e.g. V1.2.1 or older), 
please manually run all applicable SQL migration scripts in this folder. This ensures the
database is in the 'initial snapshot' state. After that, you will never have to migrate manually anymore.

If your current version is dated March 11 2014 or later, simply ignore this folder and do nothing ;-)
